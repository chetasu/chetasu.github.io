The first comic book I owned was Superman No. 75—The Death of Superman. My aunt bought it for me and I kept it and read it for several years. It wasn’t until the continuation of the “Buffy the Vampire” series in comic books was announced, that I owned another comic book. Twelve years later, we own thousands of books and I work part-time at my local comic book shop.

I’ve read hundreds of Spider-man, Batman (my favorite), Superman, Ms. Marvel, and, of course, Buffy adventures. But I’ve also expanded my reading list beyond the DC/Marvel titles, something I don’t think I would’ve done without being part of the comics community. I’ve learned about their history, the history of their creators, and about their characters. I even know how to grade comic books, thanks to my work at the store. Having an obsessive nature, I’ve even catalogued every book we own into two separate systems. CLZ and ComicsPriceGuide.com for anyone who cares.

When my husband and I were dating, he came with me to meet someone from Craigslist who was selling his collection. From then on, we’ve continued to expand our collection together. There’ve been times when we’ve had to cut back on our monthly titles and there have been fortunate times when we could expand our collection. Several times, my husband has purchased some key issues as a gift for me. It’s a collection that I hope to pass on to our daughter, but more than that, I want to pass on the stories that are in that collection. Of course, being parent to a toddler, I’m not caught up on many of those stories, but I still love buying my books.

What I’m saying is…I really love comic books and I’m grateful that my love for “Buffy” led me here.
